# Salesforce Challenge
Hi!, welcome, this is a challenge for salesforce begginers, here you will find my skills to develop LWC, Apex classes, and comunication between LWC components, in this case, parent to child events comunication.

*1 I created an app that names Salesforce Challenge whit challenge tab. 

*2 When the component is rendered in this app, all active accounts will be displayed. 

*3 Click on an account to display the entire list of related contacts.

*4 Click the edit button to edit any contact.

*5 When any contact is edited, the system sends you an email informing you that one or more contacts have been modified.
