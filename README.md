# Salesforce Challenge
Hi, welcome, this is a Salesforce beginner challenge, here you will find my skills in developing LWC, Apex classes and communication between LWC components, in this case parent-child event communication.

*1 I created an app named Salesforce Challenge with a tab named Challenge.

*2 When the component is rendered in this app, all active accounts will be displayed. 

*3 Click on an account to display the entire list of related contacts.

*4 Click the edit button to edit any contact.

*5 When any contact is edited, the system sends you an email informing you that one or more contacts have been modified.
